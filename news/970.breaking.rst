The hooks for following modules/packages have been ported to ``PyInstaller.isolated``
framework and therefore require PyInstaller >= 5.0:
- ``win32com``
- ``wx.lib.activex``
- ``enchant``
- ``sentry_sdk``
- ``ffpyplayer``
If you are still using PyInstaller 4.x and any of these packages, make sure to
pin an older version of ``pyinstaller-hooks-contrib``.
