(Linux) Remove the ``tensorflow.python._pywrap_tensorflow_internal``
hack in the ``tensorflow`` hook (i.e., adding it to excluded modules
to avoid duplication) when using PyInstaller >= 6.0, where the
duplication issue is alleviated thanks to the binary dependency analysis
preserving the parent directory layout of discovered/collected shared
libraries. This should fix the problem with ``tensorflow`` builds where
the ``_pywrap_tensorflow_internal`` module is not used as a shared
library, as seen in ``tensorflow`` builds for Raspberry Pi.
