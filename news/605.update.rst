Turn the hook for ``google.cloud`` into hook for ``google.cloud.core``
by renaming it. This hook is trying to collect metadata for
``google-cloud-core``, whereas ``google.cloud`` is a namespace package
that can be populated by other dists as well. Specifically,
``googleapis-common-protos`` puts some files there, and when
``google-cloud-core`` is not installed, the mis-named hook triggered a
missing-metadata error.
