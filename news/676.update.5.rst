Update ``tensorflow`` hook to attempt to resolve the top-level distribution
name and infer the package version from it, in order to improve version
handling when the "top-level" ``tensorflow`` dist is not installed (for
example, user installs only ``tensorflow-intel`` or ``tensorflow-macos``)
or has a different name (e.g., ``tf-nightly``).
