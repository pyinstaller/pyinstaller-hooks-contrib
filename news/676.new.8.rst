Add hooks for ``bitsandbytes``, and its dependency ``triton``. Both
packages have dynamically-loaded extension libraries that need to be
collected, and both require collection of source .py files for
(``triton``'s) JIT module. Some submodules of ``triton`` need to be
collected only as source .py files (bypassing PYZ archive), because the
code naively assumes that ``__file__`` attribute points to the source
.py file.
