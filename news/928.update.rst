Adjust the value of automatically-raised recursion limit (which :issue:`925`
set at 5000); for Windows builds of python 3.8 - 3.10 and python
3.9 available under Cygwin, the value needs to be lowered to 1900, as
higher values lead to python interpreter crash in scenarios when recursion
level actually approaches the limit (for example, the recursion limit
test in the main PyInstaller repository).
