(Linux) Update hooks for ``nvidia.cu*`` packages to suppress creation of
symbolic links to the top-level application directory for all shared
libraries collected from the packages. This fixes run-time discovery
of other shared libraries from those packages, which are dynamically
loaded at run-time (as opposed to being linked against). Specifically,
this fixes the ``Unable to load any of {libcudnn_engines_precompiled.so.9.1.0,
libcudnn_engines_precompiled.so.9.1, libcudnn_engines_precompiled.so.9,
libcudnn_engines_precompiled.so}`` and subsequent
``RuntimeError: CUDNN_BACKEND_TENSOR_DESCRIPTOR cudnnFinalize failed
cudnn_status: CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED`` when trying to use
``ultralytics`` package. This fix requires PyInstaller >= 6.11 to work,
and is no-op in earlier PyInstaller versions.
