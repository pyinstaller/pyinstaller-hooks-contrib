Extend ``tensorflow`` hook to collect plugins installed in the
``tensorflow-plugins`` directory/package. Have the run-time ``tensorflow``
hook provide an override for ``site.getsitepackages()`` that allows us
to work around a broken module file location check and trick ``tensorflow``
into loading the collected plugins.
