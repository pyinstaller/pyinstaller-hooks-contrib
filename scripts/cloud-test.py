    The **package** specifies only those to install. Which tests should be ran is inferred implicitly by
    ``@pytest.importorskip``.

    Basic usage: Launch two jobs to test the ``pycparser`` hooks on linux, Pythons 3.6 and 3.7, using the latest
    version of ``pycparser``. And open the build in a browser window.

        python cloud-test.py --py=3.6,3.7 --os=ubuntu --browser pycparser

    The **package** can be anything you'd put on the right hand side of `pip install`. Multiple packages to install can
    be separated by a space: Launch one job which installs and tests two libraries.

        python cloud-test.py pycparser==2.10 passlib==1.7.1

    Multiple versions to be run in separate jobs should be deliminated by a comma: Launch 4 x 2 = 8 jobs to test the
    ``pycparser`` hooks on windows, with all supported Pythons, against two versions of ``pycparser``.

        python cloud-test.py --py=all --os=windows pycparser==2.20, pycparser==2.16

    When you're absolutely certain your hook is ready for it, you may test everything (please use sparingly - this costs
    Github a lot of $$$). This would create 4 x 3 x 3 = 36 jobs.

        python cloud-test.py --py=all --os=all pycparser==2.16, pycparser==2.18, pycparser==2.20

    It costs Github 10x as much to run macOS as it does Linux. So please use Ubuntu as your default OS and test macOS
    last, in conservative batches. Github Actions is free for us but it won't stay that way if we abuse it.
