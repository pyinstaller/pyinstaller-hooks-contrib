Update the ``findlibs`` run-time hook to gracefully handle ``TypeError``
when using ``findlibs`` v0.1.0 with python < 3.10. This prevents the
frozen application from crashing on the run-time hook when the main
code might never end up using/importing ``findlibs`` at all (for example,
``gribapi`` module from ``eccodes`` when binary wheel with bundled
shared libraries is used).
