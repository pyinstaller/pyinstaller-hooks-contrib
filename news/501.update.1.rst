Implement preliminary support for handling subprocesses used by
``pyqtgraph.multiprocess``, for example in ``pyqtgraph``
``RemoteGraphicsView`` widget. The user is still required to ensure that
stdlib's ``multiprocessing.freeze_support`` is called in the entry-point
script before using ``pyqtgraph``. In addition, with ``onefile`` builds,
the user must set the ``_MEIPASS2`` environment variable to the value
of ``sys._MEIPASS`` before using ``pyqtgraph``.
