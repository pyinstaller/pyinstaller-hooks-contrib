Extend ``cryptography`` hook to collect OpenSSL modules (the
``ossl-modules`` directory) when available. Add a run-time hook that
overrides OpenSSL module search path by setting the ``OPENSSL_MODULES``
environment variable to the bundled ``ossl-modules`` directory. This
fixes ``RuntimeError: OpenSSL 3.0's legacy provider failed to load.``
error when using ``cryptography`` with OpenSSL >= 3.0 builds that have
modules enabled (e.g., most Linux distributions, msys/MinGW on Windows,
and Homebrew on macOS).
