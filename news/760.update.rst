Update ``hydra`` hook to include work-around for ``hydra``'s plugin
manager, which under python < 3.10 (still) uses deprecated PEP-302
that was removed from PyInstaller's ``PyiFrozenImporter`` in
PyInstaller 5.8. When building using python < 3.10 and PyInstaller >= 5.8,
the modules collected from ``hydra._internal.core_plugins`` and
``hydra_plugins`` packages are now collected as source .py files only;
this way, they are handled by built-in python's finder/importer instead
of PyInstaller's ``PyiFrozenImporter``.
