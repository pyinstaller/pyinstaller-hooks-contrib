Have ``clr`` hook check for availability of the ``pythonnet`` before
trying to query its metadata. Fixes an ``importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError``
raised by the ``clr`` hook when the hook is triggered by a module or
a package named ``clr`` other than the ``clr`` extension module from
``pythonnet``.
