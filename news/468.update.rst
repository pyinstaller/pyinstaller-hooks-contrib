Update ``cv2`` hook to add support for versions that attempt to perform module
substitution via ``sys.path`` manipulation (== 4.5.4.58, >= 4.6.0.66) when used
in combination with PyInstaller that supports setting module collection mode
in hooks (> 5.2). The  contents of the ``cv2`` package are now collected in 
source form to bypass PYZ archive and avoid compatibility issues with 
PyInstaller's  ``FrozenImporter``
