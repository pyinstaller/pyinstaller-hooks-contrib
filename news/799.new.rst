Add run-time hook for ``findlibs`` that overrides the ``findlibs.find``
function with custom implementation in order to ensure that the top-level
application directory is searched first. This prevents a system-wide
copy of the library being found and loaded instead of the bundled copy
when the system-wide copy happens to be available in one of fixed
locations that is scanned by the original implementation of ``findlibs.find``
(for example, Homebrew directory on macOS).
