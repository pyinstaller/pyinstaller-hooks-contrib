Revise the search for OpenSSL shared library and ``ossl-modules`` directory
in the ``cryptography`` hook, in order to mitigate issues with unrelated
copies of OpenSSL ending up being pulled into the build. Most notably,
the hook should not be searching for OpenSSL shared library when
``cryptography`` PyPI wheel is installed, because those ship with
extensions that are statically linked against OpenSSL.
